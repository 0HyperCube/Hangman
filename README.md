## Hangman

This is a website created in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) with the [Tide](https://docs.rs/tide/) networking framework. The frontend is done in vinilla javascript. There is just one html file and communication during the game is done through [GraphQL](graphql.org).

### Running & Editing

You can currently just run it as a local host on your own machine, but we might get hosting with a static IP once the project is almost done.

- Download rust through [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- For a good IDE with syntax highlighting, download [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and get the `rust-analizer` extention.
- If you are new to git, download a GUI such as [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/), [Git Ahead (supports linux)](https://gitahead.github.io/gitahead.com/) or just get the [command line version](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Clone the repository (https: `https://github.com/0HyperCube/Hangman.git`)
- Run the `run.py` file to open the page and build the project.
